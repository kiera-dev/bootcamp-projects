Some of the projects I worked on during my coding bootcamp (in no particular order): <br>

**C#**

* Login
	* Simple login & registration form
* Bank
	* asp.net core & MySQL
	* Assignment: "Create an app that allows users to register and log in. After a user logs in, they should be taken to an account page that displays their bank records. Users should be shown an error if they try to withdraw more than their balance. If a user tries to access another user's account page, they should be redirected. Withdraw and deposit use the same form, which should accept positive or negative numbers.
